# dog_breed_image_classifier
### dog_breed_image_classifier is a sample that shows developers how to classify images of dogs to particular breeds using a pre-trained image classifier. 
## Prerequisites:
- Operating system: Any OS 
- Framework infrastructure: Python 3.7+
- Knowledge: This was taken from a class project I did on Udacity.com.  There is a sample run_models_batch.sh shell script that runs some samples. You can take a look at the script to see what calls what.  Good Luck!

## Usage:
sh run_models_batch.sh
